2/2/2019 20:09:30,"Goodwin Memorial Library in Hadley, MA",http://www.hadleyma.org/pages/hadleyma_library/index (though it appears to be down right now?),No Fines,"No, but I can see in a cached version of their website (since it's currently down), the following: ""Late Fees  As of June 2016 the Goodwin Library no longer charges fines for returned Hadley items (with the exception of eReaders and Museum Passes). When borrowing items from the Goodwin Library, please understand the following policies regarding fees and fines. While the Library no longer collects fines for overdue items, fines will still appear in your library record when an item becomes overdue. the Evergreen automated library system utilizes the standard accruals for various library items (generally $.10/day for a book and $1/day for a DVD). When a borrower's account reaches the blocking threshold of $10 that patron's account will be frozen until the issue is resolved. When late items are returned, fines accrued for items owned by Hadley will be waived. Fines for overdue items belonging to other libraries will NOT be waived.    In lieu of fines, patrons are welcome to make small donations to the Friends of the Goodwin Memorial Library. A jar will be placed on the counter for this purpose. Larger gifts to the Library are always welcome – Please see the Library Donation Policy for more information."""
