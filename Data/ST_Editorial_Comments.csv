So there you have the problem. City Council should learn how to prioritize and budget properly. Vote ""No"" and send a message for city council to fund core city services and put non-essential programs on the ballot.

""you’re not going to choose paying fines over eating,”

That's the wrong comparison to make. Low income people can choose to return books on time over paying fines.

9,walter mitty,6/26/19,2:26 PM,"Unless something compelling causes me to change my mind, I plan on voting NO. Government sponsored programs and services are created, in theory, to support the needs of the residents within their community. If the service needs grow, the support base can chip in to fund the services which have proven to be a need.  

I reviewed annual reports from the library website (2007 to 2016) and what stuck out in my mind was this:

Library materials checked out by children increased slightly, while people attending library programs saw a surge. There were new metrics as a result of technology such as increase in online streamed materials, as an example.

Noteworthy, however, was the decline in adult materials checked out (DOWN 26%), media use – DVD, audiobooks, CDs (DOWN 42%), library visitors (DOWN 24%), customers contacting the library with reference questions (DOWN 32%).

Personnel costs increased 8% with a corresponding increase in payroll, up 38%. ($39m in 2009 to $52.8m in 2016).

Infusions of money saw $196m in 1998 (levy), $123m in 2012 (bond). Now, the library is asking for an additional $218.1m. Let’s just round that off to half a billion dollars in 20 years…over and above the City's general funding.

The proposed levy seeks to leverage property owners into subsidizing library services, some of which (my opinion) do not rise to the level of NEED, nor do they match the services requested by their consumer base. They seem to fall more under “boy it sure would be neat if we” like options on a car….so the push is on now to try and convince Seattle residents that they really need these improvements. Kind of a 'we know what's good for you' instead of ""you've asked for these improvement again and again.""

During this same period of time, my property tax on my small footprint home has increased $2000/yr. This nickel and diming of claims against my property is hidden behind glowing, altruistic sound bites with labels which pander to voters’ emotions. This is where I take a stand against unabated spending by government agencies.

Why not operate the library within their budget and means?  Structure the services without all the pie in the sky, unicorn and rainbow options? Quit looking to property owners as your cash cow…. which is quite different than asking each voter... which includes those who do not have a direct nexus to property tax responsibility, to step up and chipping in?

There are way too many other City services which I feel have a higher priority which I’m more likely to dig a little deeper and make a sacrifice given my limited income status.

Libraries have evolved over the past 20 years due to technology.  More homes and people have access to information and learning services which bypass the traditional library.  Libraries have found it challenging to remain relevant in their communities than ever before.  The details of the proposed levy just aren't compelling enough for me.  I'm voting NO.",no,na,na,17,no
10,springthaw,6/27/19,2:48 AM,"Thank you for your research and the number crunching. Those numbers reflect what many library systems all over the US are facing, less usage. It’s why SPL is venturing into offering classes and social services in trying to stay relevant and up the usage number. 

Many of the SPL programs such as ESL class , citizenship class, homework help, basic computer literacy class are duplicating what many Seattle nonprofits already offered to the public.  Goodwill, Literacy Source, Seattle Community Colleges, El Centro de la Reza, Catholic charities, Seattle Public Schools, and the many local nonprofits that work with immigrants and the poor have similar programs in place.  In addition, many of the people who need such help don’t live in Seattle because it’s unaffordable.  It’s why the need for such programs are in places like Tukwila, SeaTac, and Burien. 

I can see a library Levy for capital improvement. 

I will vote NO because this Levy is too expensive and the library shouldn’t be wasting tax dollars trying to offer services already well covered by many non-profits (which do a better job) or other city departments.

I also have mixed feelings about getting rid of late fines. The library shouldn’t impose fines on children's books and materials, but adults are fair game.  Get rid of the fine and people will hang onto these book longer than necessary and keep them out of circulation- which goes against the purpose of a circulating library. ",yes,walter mitty,9,4,no
11,Iibqa,6/26/19,2:02 PM,"I am firmly against this levy because of the proposed policy to eliminate fines for overdue and unreturned/lost materials. This is an invitation for more irresponsible behavior. If the primary purpose of public libraries is for everyone to share in its resources, then how can we share when some people aren't taking seriously the requirement to return checked-out items in a timely way. It should be a privilege, and not just a right, to have a library card. If someone cannot bide by the rules of the library return policy, and refuses to pay the small fines, their privileges ought to be taken away. They can still use library resources, but should not be permitted to remove them from the library.

Are there programs or costs (payroll or operational) that are currently coming out of the general fund that will switch to levy dollars if this passes?

For those who don't read much or visit libraries regularly, paying that much isn't worth it. They might be thinking, ""I want to keep my $7 a month. I don't want to donate it so others can read a book."" 

But the libraries aren't measured by worth; they are measured by value.

There is value in being able to check out (for free) $300 worth of books on landscaping when you are putting in irrigation in your back yard. Instead of buying the books at Home Depot. There is value in having a young student in a limited-income household be able to get information for a school paper, instead of trying to buy it from a bookstore.

Most of us on are on ""limited"" incomes, in so much as we only make what we make, and behing salaried exempt means it's fixed as well. But it's true that to me, as modest as my income is, a couple of bucks worth of fines aren't a big deal, but I'm just as likely to lose or forget to return a book as someone on a ""limited or fixed income"". I have a full-time job, a full-time project house/garden, and two active dogs. I don't have kids or a hugely active social life, for which I am grateful since I already feel like there aren't enough hours in the day. I get up insanely early in the morning, and am still running to catch a bus to work, as well as home in the afternoon. And I rarely get to bed ""on time"", so I always feel like I'm behind on sleep. What makes you think I'm less likely to forget a book on a bus, or forget to throw it in my bag when it's time to return it?

I'll tell you what would make you think it. It's a word... Starts with an ""R"", ends in ""ility"". C'mon, I know you know it!

Although, I will admit to having had overdue book fines a couple of times in my life.  It's been a long time and they were modest ones, like a day late or so. I paid them. And once I lost a book, but I replaced it.

The choice is not between paying fines and eating. The choice is between being a responsible library patron and member of community (which does not have a minimum income requirement)! and returning the book on time, or being a self-absorbed individual who has no consideration for other patrons (who also might very well be on a limited or fixed income) who are waiting to borrow the book that you took and can't be bothered to bring back.

Or, if you just want to make it all about you...it's about bringing the book back on time and being able to continue to use the library, or not. If you're one of the 19% of users who are one of ""those who may need the library the most"", then wouldn't you be really motivated not to be late? You're able to get to the library to use it when you ""need"" it, but not able to get there to return a book?

The rules don't apply to you because of the amount of money you make (or don't)? Really?
I support more money for libraries. I don't support ending fines, or the mentality behind it. And I especially don't support enabling others in their abdication of all responsibiity in life. Because you know it doesn't end with not getting library books back on time.",no,na,na,20,yes

24,MMBU,6/27/19,9:21 AM,"I didn't say I looked down on people, or that lower-income people are somehow less than I am. I said I don't support the mentality that is proposing to eliminate fines. That is true whether it be a person who thinks they are doing this to help the less fortunate, or if it someone who is less fortunate who believes they shouldn't have to live by the same rules.

I really do have a problem with this idea that somehow, asking lower-income people to follow the rules of using a public service is akin to asking them to starve themselves. They aren't being asked to starve themselves...they are being asked to follow the rules like everyone else. Why is that unreasonable?

Substitue library fines with something else. More serious, perhaps. For example, let's say you get hit by a drunk driver. Does it actually matter how much money the perpetrator makes? Is it less egregious that they decided to get behind the wheel iif they make $35K a year, as opposed to someone who makes $70K? Or if they run a red light and endanger pedestrians? Neglect their children? Or even just dump their old mattress in your neighborhood? At what point do you say...""Because you don't make as much money as other people, I'm okay with you doing this""? 

And yes, a late library book is many, many times less serious than driving drunk or child neglect, but it does still impact other people. Library staff, the cost to the library system as a whole, as well as other patrons. So if you're using the library with no regard to how your actions impact others, you are being self-absorbed and irresponsible, and there simply shouldn't be a income requirement that excuses that kind of behavior.

My point is not that I'm so wonderful and everyone else is so terrible. My point is that while yes, I can afford the fines, I have plenty of excuses as to why I might be late returning a library book...and none of those excuses matter. I checked it out, I bring it back, or there are consequences.

I simply don't believe that people who make less money should be less reponsible than those who make more. Moreover, I don't think it helps anyone to be absolved of their responsiblities in society.

Bird Week We celebrated Seattle Bird Week April 23-30. In partnership with the Seward Park Audubon Center and other local organizations, we hosted nature writing classes, bird sketching and more.

Booktoberfest Each fall, our librarians visit your favorite bars and pubs for Booktoberfest, our celebration of books, beer and good cheer. (such a great expense of time and money!!!!)

Know Your Rights We can help you understand your legal rights as an immigrant or refugee. (shouldn't this be done at city hall?)

Library Link Library Link is a pilot collaboration between The Seattle Public Library and Seattle Public Schools to connect middle school student with online resources and media. (this should be in the middle school  libraries, not duplicated)

Library Lounge Raise a glass to literature in the Library Lounge, a moveable feast of events and celebrations all around Seattle that combine literature and libations.

Make and Build Come to your Library and learn how to program robots, create a mobile app, make crafts with electrical circuits and other fun projects. (again, something that should be done at schools)

Movies We screen free movies at many of our neighborhood branches and we also occasionally host curated film festivals covering a wide spectrum of topics and interests Icon

Museum Pass Your Library helps you get free admission to participating Seattle museums.
