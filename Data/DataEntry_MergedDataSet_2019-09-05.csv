243,Lansing Public Library,Everyone,https://lansingpl.org/news/why-lansing-public-library-went-fine-free-starting-may-1,FALSE,"1) Fines create barriers to information. Director Debbie Albrecht cites an example of people who are looking for a job ‚Äî ‚ÄúIf they have overdue book fines, they are blocked from using the computers to job search. If your money is already limited, late fees just compound your problems.‚Äù Albrecht‚Äôs philosophy is that the library should be a resource to anyone who needs it.  2) Fines actually prevent people from returning materials. Albrecht knows that once an overdue fine reaches a certain level, she is not likely to ever see that book again: ‚ÄúPeople don‚Äôt return it because they do not want to deal with overdue fines!‚Äù By wiping away late fees, she explains, the stigma is removed and the materials are returned and made accessible to other patrons. ‚ÄúSome traditionalists will argue that without fines there is no incentive to return a book on time,‚Äù says Albrecht. But she counters, ‚ÄúYes there is‚Äîyou appeal to people‚Äôs good side.‚Äù  3) Fines are not an important source of library revenue. Lansing Public Library has seen decreased revenue from fines over the years, and Albrecht believes it will not be a hardship to replace that revenue. In fact, she already received notification that the library will be receiving $35,414 in per capita grant funds this year, which is about a $14,000 increase from the previous year. That plus an anticipated increase in revenue from printing and copying done by library patrons will more than make up for the revenue from fines. ",41.566202,-87.549574,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

I‚Äôve talked to libraries that don‚Äôt do fines and don‚Äôt have a problem losing material because of a lack of incentive to bring things back on time.  Fines have never been about revenue. Fines punish loyal patrons who just can‚Äôt get a book finished in time or elderly patrons who don‚Äôt want to venture out in bad weather just to return a book. Those irresponsible people who don‚Äôt care about the fine and aren‚Äôt going to return material regardless will always be part of the equation. We could fine them ten cents or $10 a day and turn them over the collections, they don‚Äôt care.‚Äù After much deliberation, she approached the Library Board of Trustees with the idea to eliminate fines. Once she explained her reasons and the results of her research, the Board agreed to change the policy. Staff, said Lowery, was more skeptical. ‚ÄúI asked staff if they really felt good about telling a kid that they weren‚Äôt allowed to check out a book because they owed a fine. I asked them if they enjoyed arguing with people over ten cents when those people were not going to follow the rules no matter what. Is that worth it?‚Äù Lowery said the biggest concern her staff expressed is that there would be no incentive for irresponsible patrons to bring things back on time without the fines. ‚ÄúI asked them if they really thought that $1 a day fine mattered to the people who weren‚Äôt intending to pay it in the first place. We‚Äôve always had those people and will continue to see them come and go; with or without fines. I‚Äôd rather focus on the 99% of responsible patrons.‚Äù",41.084113,-82.398545,"If you have overdue items, you will not be able to check out more material until those items are renewed or returned.
