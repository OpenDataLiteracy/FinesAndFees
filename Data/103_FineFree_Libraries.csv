Director Debbie Albrecht cites an example of people who are looking for a job ‚Äî ‚ÄúIf they have overdue book fines, they are blocked from using the computers to job search. If your money is already limited, late fees just compound your problems.‚Äù Albrecht‚Äôs philosophy is that the library should be a resource to anyone who needs it.  2) Fines actually prevent people from returning materials. Albrecht knows that once an overdue fine reaches a certain level, she is not likely to ever see that book again: ‚ÄúPeople don‚Äôt return it because they do not want to deal with overdue fines!‚Äù By wiping away late fees, she explains, the stigma is removed and the materials are returned and made accessible to other patrons. ‚ÄúSome traditionalists will argue that without fines there is no incentive to return a book on time,‚Äù says Albrecht. But she counters, ‚ÄúYes there is‚Äîyou appeal to people‚Äôs good side.‚Äù  3) Fines are not an important source of library revenue. Lansing Public Library has seen decreased revenue from fines over the years, and Albrecht believes it will not be a hardship to replace that revenue. In fact, she already received notification that the library will be receiving $35,414 in per capita grant funds this year, which is about a $14,000 increase from the previous year.
